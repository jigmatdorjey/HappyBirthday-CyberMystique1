    <p id="paraMP">In the big, wild mountains, where the air is fresh and the land is tough, 
      there was this wanderer guy called Synth. He spent his days walking around 
      the rough landscapes, finding peace in nature's hug.
      One time, all the nomad folks gathered by campfire, 
      telling tales of their journeys. There was this bold and free-spirited 
      woman named Mystic who grabbed Synth's attention. Mystic, 
      full of adventure and the wind messing up her wild hair, 
      had something about her that pulled Synth in.
      <br><br>
      As Synth and Mystic travelled through the big, beautiful mountains, 
      they often ran into each other. They swapped stories about wild storms, 
      run-ins with tricky animals, and the amazing views they saw. Synth really 
      liked how brave and passionate Mystic was about the mountains. It felt 
      like they had a connection that went beyond just being fellow wanderers.
      
      As time went on, Synth couldn't ignore that he was starting to really 
      like Mystic. His heart felt heavy with unsaid feelings, like a quiet 
      stream flowing in the mountains. Synth often daydreamed about the times 
      they spent together under the wide mountain sky.
      <br><br>
      In a quiet valley, surrounded by tall peaks, Synth decided to tell 
      Mystic how he felt. He wrote a sweet message, talking about how 
      much he admired her adventurous spirit and how much joy she added 
      to his wandering. With a bit of nervousness, he handed the note to 
      Mystic as the wind whispered through the rocky peaks.
      <br>
      Mystic was moved by Synth's honesty and the rugged beauty of his feelings. 
      She really valued their friendship but didn't feel the same romantic way. 
      Synth, although feeling a bit let down, took it in stride, tough like the 
      mountains. They kept on with their nomadic adventures, with Synth quietly 
      holding onto his one-sided love. Even though he found comfort in the vast 
      mountain scenes, deep down, he wished for a connection with Mystic that went
       beyond just being friends.
       <br><br>
      As they roamed through the high mountains, Synth stuck by Mystic's side, 
      sharing all the ups and downs of their mountain life. Mystic, not knowing 
      about Synth's hidden feelings, continued to cherish their friendship amid the 
      peaks and valleys. And so, in the big, open sky of the mountain realm, 
      their nomadic story unfolded, a mix of friendship and love that was felt but unsaid

      Why do I still chase after you? I think the first dream of 
      you is a sign that we are not going to be together. In the dream, 
      you came for a moment, and from that moment, I had to understand that 
      you are only in my life for a short duration, but still, I chase you.

      Life is so unpredictable, isn't it? It's strange to think that just 
      four years ago, we didn't even know each other. Back in school, 
      we spent two years together, but we never really talked much. 
      I remember asking you for notes, and that was about it.
      But now, things have taken a different turn. These days, 
      not hearing from you for just a week feels like a real struggle
      to find happiness. I've read those posts that talk about how 
      one-sided expectations can really mess with your head, and 
      I think I might be going through that right now. I wish 
      I could stop thinking about you, but the more I try, 
      the harder it becomes. 
      I know deep down that you're not going to be mine, but 
      this heart of mine keeps holding on, hoping against all odds. 
      As there is no hope but in no hope I can see hope.

      My exams are coming up, and I really want to focus on 
      my studies, but my mind keeps drifting back to thoughts 
      of you. It's tough, and I don't even know why.

Some say it's painful to wait for someone. Some say it's more 
painful to forget someone. But, the worst pain comes when 
you don't know whether to wait or forget

       <br>
        <span class="dotM">............................</span>
       <br>
       Looking back at our story, it's evident that you were the one 
       consistently maintaining our connection by initiating messages 
       and calls. There was a time when I messaged you without hesitation, 
       but over time, I started to feel like you were always busy, and 
       I anxiously awaited your messages every day. I want to express my 
       gratitude for your messages, as they mean a lot to me.
       If you had never messaged me, I would have carried on with 
       life as usual, but I always hoped to hear from you. 
       We used to exchange messages spontaneously, without 
       any set day or time, but as time passed, I found myself creating a 
       mental schedule, mainly expecting messages from you during the 
       weekends or to message you on Saturday.
       <br>I wish I could message you more often, especially during the 
       weekends, but a lack of courage holds me back. Please, 
       continue to send messages as you always have; it's bring emotional 
       comfort and joy to my life.

      My life is consumed by stress and depression. 
      I worry about the future, feel lonely despite 
      being surrounded by beautiful and supportive 
      people. Stress is taking a toll on my health 
      and time. I've never experienced the level of 
      stress and pain on the brain before college.
      The pain in my brain  is unbearable, and it 
      feels like my mind is about to explode. When 
      I'm with people, the pain lessens, but as soon 
      as the conversation ends, my suffering intensifies.
      and yesterday, unexpectedly, I received a message 
      from CyberMystique asking, 'Are you free? Do you want 
      to chat?' It made me happy, but simultaneously, 
      it hurt me deeply due to this kind of nonsense 
      question. Maybe she thought I was busy, but in 
      reality, I am free 24 hours a day and I want and 
      wish to chat with her all the time.  day before 
      Yesterday, my WhatsApp was mistakenly deleted, 
      erasing all the chat history with everyone. However, 
      I felt a moment of sadness and cried because it deleted 
      my conversation with CyberMystique, the only one that made me 
      laugh and brought me joy every time. Today, we chatted for 
      about 3 hours, which is the best time I've spent this week.

      Relationships are a beautiful journey, but they can bring about 
      changes in our priorities. If you find your life partner, 
      it's possible that your priorities, including the time you 
      used to spend with me, may shift.
      It's amazing how life can change so drastically. There was a time 
      when we didn't even know each other, and now, you're at the top 
      of my priority list. I would go to great lengths, even sacrificing 
      my sleep and study time, just to be there for you. 
      But as life goes on, relationships change. Conversations become 
      shorter, the time we spend chatting gets replaced by other 
      commitments, and so on. From being close friends who talked 
      all the time, we might evolve into only exchanging messages 
      once a year, usually on birthdays.
      Yet, one thing remains certain: we will be friends forever. 
      I'll always cherish those days when we were so close, and
      I'll miss them dearly.

      After that first dream with you, you keep showing up in my 
      dreams, and oddly, each one ends the same: I simply wake up.
      Every time, my dreams explore colorful tales, filled with joy 
      and beauty. Just as the story gets enchanting, you suddenly 
      appear, bringing surprise and wonder. Sadly, the dream always 
      ends there, leaving me wishing for more time in that magical 
      moment with you.

      Once upon a time, I used to be someone who only cared about 
      sports and never really noticed girls. But now whenever, 
      I think about a girl, or maybe I'm just looking for a partner, 
      everything feels different. I don't really understand how my 
      mind changed so much. Maybe it's like how animal, after some 
      time, start looking for partner. Even though animal don't think 
      like we do, they still search for a partner. I think I'm at 
      that stage of being a human where I need a special someone 
      to share my love and make our new journey.

      As in past chapter, my aim isn't to seek your pity or sympathy.
      Writing brings me joy, and with each passing day, I find

      As I navigate this journey of learning and improvement, 
      there's a genuine desire to leave an impression. I sincerely 
      hope you enjoy the unfolding narrative.
