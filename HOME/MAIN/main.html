    <p>Once upon a time, there was a kind old man named Mr.J who lived 
      alone in a cozy cottage by the river. Every day, he fed the birds 
      that visited his garden. One winter, a rare bluebird with a bright 
      red feather on its wing started coming to his window. Mr.J and 
      the bluebird became friends. They'd share stories, and the bird 
      even sang beautiful songs. But one day, Mr.J fell seriously ill. 
      Worried for his friend, the bluebird flew away. As the days passed, 
      Mr.J's health improved, but he missed his feathered friend. Then, 
      one sunny morning, the bluebird returned, perched on his windowsill. 
      It had brought a sprig of wildflowers as a get-well gift. 
      Their friendship remained a heartwarming true story for years to come.

    <p> Once upon a time, there was an old man named Synth who looked 
      after a tall lighthouse near the sea. His job was to make sure ships 
      didn't crash into rocks during storms. One stormy night, a ship was 
      in trouble, and Synth used the lighthouse to guide it to safety. 
      Among the people on the ship was a young woman named Mystique. 
      She was very brave. As the storms went away, Synth and 
      Mystique became friends. Even though he was old and she 
      was young, they liked each other a lot. Their friendship showed

      I've been working on this letter for many days and plan to complete it on September 30th,

      we started chatting, and I understand you'll be busy on your special day.

        At that time, it was an extremely embarrassing 
        moment for me. From that moment, I pledged to 
        myself that I would wish you first on this 
        birthday, but <span id="dot">.......

        <br>
        I also remember my birthday when you were 
        the only one who wished me. I'm happy that
         at least one person remembered me on my 
         birthday, whether it was just for formality 
         🙏😅 or genuinely 🙏🥰. Thank you for that day. 
         That small message made my day (in chat 😅🤣

      Time goes on, and we completed our 11th and 12th 
      grades through offline and online modes. Now we are
      in our 3rd year. I don't have many memories of 
      offline school with you, but I have many from online ,
       the time I spent with you. I used to like you from 
       school. I'm still confused about words like like, 
       love, and crush. Same as earlier, time goes on, 
       as time and tide wait for none. With time, we 
       share our day, feelings 🤔, and meet frequently 
       through WhatsApp. And like this, I got addicted 
       to you. The more time I spend with you, the more 
       addicted I become. This is more dangerous than drugs, 
       which consume my time and space in my mind, but I 
       enjoy every second. While I'm chatting with you, my 
       face is always in smile mode; I don't know why.

       <br>
       During this summer holiday, one day I'm with family, 
       and I'm chatting in front of them. I had said earlier 
       that my face is always in smile mode when I chat 
       with you. At that moment, they observed me and 
       asked what happened to me, why I am so happy 
       and smiling. My reply: nothing 😁, just a video. 
       That moment made me realize I'm really enjoying 
       pure happiness.

       <br>
       About dating 🤣, I am happy that you accepted for the moment, 
       and at that time, I didn't have any feelings towards you. 
       But after some days, I don't know why, somewhere I started 
       getting emotional thinking about that, and tears welled up 
       in my eyes. As time goes on, I think about you more and more, 
       and there's a moment when I get totally frustrated. 
       But when I receive a message, I enter smile mode and 
       am happy for a couple of days. It's more like fake 
       than true but 💯% true.I try to find out if I'm in love 
       or it's just infatuation. <br>
       I'm still on this journey.

      I've wanted to share this with you from many sessions, 
      but I lacked the courage to do so. Now, I'm feeling 
      lighter. When I sought a review from my friend, they 
      asked, "Is it a love letter?" This is not a love/purpose 
      letter nor an attempt to seek sympathy. It's just my feelings 
      toward you and the memories we share. Thanks for these 
      memories 😇.Now, on the occasion of your birthday, 
      <br>❤️ my wish is for you to have a bright career and a healthy life. ❤️ 
      <br>
       That's it.
