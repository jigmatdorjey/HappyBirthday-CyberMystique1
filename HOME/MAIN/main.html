    <p id="paraMP">Once upon a time, there was a kind old man named Mr.J who lived 
      alone in a cozy cottage by the river. Every day, he fed the birds 
      that visited his garden. One winter, a rare bluebird with a bright 
      red feather on its wing started coming to his window. Mr.J and 
      the bluebird became friends. They'd share stories, and the bird 
      even sang beautiful songs. But one day, Mr.J fell seriously ill. 
      Worried for his friend, the bluebird flew away. As the days passed, 
      Mr.J's health improved, but he missed his feathered friend. Then, 
      one sunny morning, the bluebird returned, perched on his windowsill. 
      It had brought a sprig of wildflowers as a get-well gift. 
      Their friendship remained a heartwarming true story for years to come.

        At that time, it was an extremely embarrassing

        I also remember my birthday when you were 
        the only one who wished me. I'm happy that
         at least one person remembered me on my 
         birthday, whether it was just for formality 
         🙏😅 or genuinely 🙏🥰. Thank you for that day. 
         That small message made my day (in chat 😅🤣

        Since childhood, birthday celebrations were a rarity to ___ , an experience that fellow hostellers can empathize with and understand,
         and I didn't even know my own birthdate until class 9th(During 10th board exam registration i discovered).
         I used to despise my birthday, but I had a fondness for other birthdays,
         particularly those of day scholar students, where we would often receive candies and chocolates
        Just like those one-rupee candies that brought so much joy during my hostel days, you bring happiness to my life now.

      Time goes on, and we completed our 11th and 12th 
      grades through offline and online modes. Now we are
      in our 3rd year. I don't have many memories of 
      offline school with you, but I have many from online ,
       the time I spent with you. I used to like you from 
       school. I'm still confused about words like like, 
       love, and crush. Same as earlier, time goes on, 
       as time and tide wait for none. With time, we 
       share our day, feelings 🤔, and meet frequently 
       through WhatsApp. And like this, I got addicted 
       to you. The more time I spend with you, the more 
       addicted I become. This is more captivating than drugs(Which I have never tried), 
       which consume my time and space in my mind, but I 
       enjoy every second and there is no regret. While I'm chatting with you, my 
       face is always in smile mode; I don't know why.

       During this summer holiday, one day I'm with family, 
       and I'm chatting in front of them. I had said earlier 
       that my face is always in smile mode when I chat 
       with you. At that moment, they observed me and 
       asked what happened to me, why I am so happy 
       and smiling. My reply: nothing 😁, just a video. 
       That moment made me realize I'm really enjoying 
       pure happiness.

       About dating 🤣, I am happy that we are for the moment(darung yakin chamerakga nga.ngay mazak chos tay
        yindo samadho) , 
       and at that time, I didn't have any feelings towards you. 
       But after some days, I don't know why, somewhere I started 
       getting emotional thinking about that, and tears welled up 
       in my eyes. As time goes on, I think about you more and more, 
       and there's a moment when I get totally frustrated. 
       But when I receive a message, I enter smile mode and 
       am happy for a couple of days. It's more like fake 
       than true but 💯% true.I try to find out if I'm in love 
       or it's just infatuation. <br>
       I'm still on this journey.

      One word of yours that rings in my ears and mind every

      <p id="p1">
      Today, on August 1, 2023, for the first time in my life,
       Rabyang appeared in my dream alongside her sister, 
       Yangdol, for a brief moment. It seemed like we were 
       at a gathering, and you were on the verge of entering 
       the function. There was a considerable distance between 
       us, and you were wearing the clothes you usually wear.
        With all my heart, I shouted your name, but behind me, 
        Yangdol and, I believe, another sister, urged me to 
        move forward. As a result, my eye contact with you shifted, 
        and you also vanished from my dream.

      <br>
      17-09-2023<br>Yesterday, I had a conversation with Rabyang for 
      one hour and a couple of minutes. It's like magic; 
      the stress I have, the pain I'm  suffering, 
      everything is gone. It's magical. It was our second 
      video call of a duration of more than 1 hour. Earlier, 
      I loved chatting more than calling or video, but now 
      I'm really enjoying the call. Thank God I have someone 
       I can trust 🤔😁 and share my feelings with, just like I'm 
       sharing with you(whatsapp myself). I enjoyed every 
       moment with Rabyang. As time goes on, my feelings 
       toward her are growing stronger. I hope our relationship 
       will get stronger, but if not, goes like as it is.When I
      talk and chat with Rabyang, for a couple of days, my mood is 
      on the next level—pure happiness. As I told Rabyang yesterday 
      about going to bed at 8:30 during Saturday, the actual reason 
      is that I'm just waiting for Rabyang's message so that I can 
      chat continuously without disturbance 😂.
      <br>
      When I feel lonely and stressed, I write, keeping 
      Rabyang's face in mind and the conversations we've 
      had earlier. It makes me feel like Rabyang is with me. 
      Also, the best thing during lonely times is reading 
      our chat. It gives me courage and inner peace. Thanks, Rabyang.You make 
      me the happiest person on Earth for a while. I feel joy when 
      I see your face, hear your voice, and read the messages you 
      type. When I feel depressed, all I do is think about you, 
      and it puts me in a good state.
